# CH2-PS505 - Bangkit Academy 2023 Capstone Team Project by Diagnofish
Greetings! üëã Welcome to the fantastic world of team CH2-PS505! We're a collective of dedicated individuals embarking on a mission to transform the landscape of aquatic health and fisheries.

## Project Overview
Our initiative revolves around crafting an Android-centric application tailored for detecting diseases in affected fish. An important aspect of this app involves analyzing images of afflicted fish submitted by users. Leveraging machine learning, the application processes these images to identify the specific disease, offering insights on treatment strategies and preventative measures.

## Why it Matters
Disease control in fish is one of the important aspects that determine the success of fish farming. Fish diseases are caused by a combination of three factors, namely the condition of the fish, environmental conditions, and the presence of pests. By knowing the types and causes of fish diseases, fish farmers can know how to handle, mitigate, and prevent them appropriately.

## Download Diagnofish App
üî¨ **Diagnofish** ‚Äì Diagnose Your Fish Disease\
Diagnofish is an intelligent tool designed to help identify fish diseases easily and accurately. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can upload photos or describe symptoms to receive instant diagnostic results based on the latest aquaculture knowledge.

## üöß Service Status
‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice:
The Diagnofish app **requires user login** to access its features.
Currently, the backend service is **offline**, which means the app cannot be used until the service is back online.

We will update this section once the service is active again. Thank you for your patience!

## Task Distribution
We have distributed our project development into several different branches of tasks to guarantee efficient growth and coordination. The following is an overview of each branch:
- Machine Learning: This branch focuses on creating advanced algorithms for machine learning and computer vision that enable fish disease recognition from images.
- Mobile Development: In this branch, we develop Android applications for our projects that are easy to use and intuitive.
- Cloud Computing: This branch focuses on developing backend services required for processing and is responsible for deploying services to the cloud and ensuring data fluidity.

## Get involved
Community cooperation and contributions are greatly appreciated! We'd love to talk to you, whether you're a developer, subject matter expert, or just interested in our projects. Join us as we transform the field of aquaculture and change the world for the better!
