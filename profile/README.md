Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the fantastic world of team C23-PS448! We're a collective of dedicated individuals embarking on a mission to transform the landscape of aquatic health and fisheries.

## Project Overview

Our initiative revolves around crafting an Android-centric application tailored for detecting diseases in fish. The pivotal aspect of this app involves analyzing images of afflicted fish submitted by users. Leveraging machine learning, the application processes these images to identify the specific disease, offering insights on treatment strategies and preventative measures
